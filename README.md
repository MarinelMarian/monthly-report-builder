# Monthly report builder


## Previous Workflow

Working with the team on a research project, we must fill in a monthly report that needs to contain a summary of relevant activities done each day (commits, PRs, communications, meetings, decisions, etc.).
This is a very tedious job and it usually takes around 6 hours to complete. 

## Solution Description
By using the data gathered from the:
+ monthly calendar (meetings) from Outlook
+ the history of all chat conversations (and calls) from Microsoft Teams 
+ the commits and PRs from AzureDevops 
+ artifacts in Jira and Confluence 

the raw data can be given to GPT to compile a monthly report of summarized activities broken down by days.


## Deployment
Since the time was not sufficient to write all the data connectors (to Microsoft Graph API, AzureDevops API, Jira and Confluence API), I've created a JSON with manually added entries to have a functional POC.
I've built this on top of the chatGPT rephrasing example, and if you give a valid JSON input such as this:
```json
{"conversations":[{"id":1,"name":"Daily","messages":[{"id":1,"text":"Hey guys, are your ready for our daily standup?","timestamp":"2023-05-01T10:29:29Z","user":{"id":1,"name":"Marinel"}},{"id":2,"text":"Sure, let's do it!","timestamp":"2023-05-01T10:30:30Z","user":{"id":2,"name":"Ana"}},{"id":3,"text":"Great meeting guys! As mentioned in the meeting, I will be on vacation next week.","timestamp":"2023-05-01T10:58:58Z","user":{"id":3,"name":"Alex"}},{"id":4,"text":"With Alex on vacation I need somebody to take over his tasks. Any volunteers?","timestamp":"2023-05-09T13:29:29Z","user":{"id":1,"name":"Marinel"}},{"id":5,"text":"Count me in! I will take over Alex's tasks and prepare the demo for them.","timestamp":"2023-05-09T13:45:45Z","user":{"id":4,"name":"Dani"}},{"id":6,"text":"I just finished the prep for the demo. Marinel, I will send you the link to the demo in a few minutes.","timestamp":"2023-05-12T09:05:00Z","user":{"id":4,"name":"Dani"}},{"id":7,"text":"Great! I'm looking forward to it.","timestamp":"2023-05-12T09:15:00Z","user":{"id":1,"name":"Marinel"}},{"id":8,"text":"Guys, the demo went great!

```

You should be able to get back an activity report like this:
```json
[{
    "date": "2023-05-01",
    "summary": "Daily standup conversation held, Alex was reminded to fill in his timesheet before vacation."
  }, {
    "date": "2023-05-09",
    "summary": "Marinel asked for volunteers to fill in Alex's tasks while on vacation, and Dani volunteered."
  }, {
    "date": "2023-05-12",
    "summary": "Demo meeting was held, Dani finished preparing the demo, and sent the link to Marinel."
  }, {
    "date": "2023-05-13",
    "summary": "Retro meeting was held, Demo went great and the team got the green light to implement additional features, Alex drew attention to the time constraints of achieving all of them."
  }, {
    "date": "2023-05-14",
    "summary": "A commit was made that merged a pull request #1 from repo/branch."
  }
]
```
